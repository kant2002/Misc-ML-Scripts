* F^{★}
This directory contains a bunch of F^{★} work along with helpers


** Notable files
- _Making F^{*} easier to run_
  - =cache-fstar-source.lisp=
    + This lisp file will cache F^{★} code recursively for you, so call it
      once on a file via
      #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
        (fix-script:generate-cache "file.fst")
      #+END_SRC
      * *Probably* has to be in the same directory as the file, as F^{★}
        can be rather finicky with names.
      * This will also cache your standard library
  - =Interopt/=
    + See the readme for that folder
