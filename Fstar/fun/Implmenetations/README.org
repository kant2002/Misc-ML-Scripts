* Creations of the G-machine
- This code is done in =F*=, accompanying =Coq= code will also be
  provided once I figure out termination proofs
- This is an implementation of 'Implementing Functional Languages a
  tutorial' by Simon L Peyton Jones
  + Currently only the syntax of chapter 1, and the beginning of
    chapter 2 is complete
- This also serves as a good tutorial on tactics and other techniques
  in =F*=
  + Hopefully an article will be written by me about this after this
    project is complete
