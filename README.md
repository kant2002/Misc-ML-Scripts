#Misc-Haskell-Scripts
Some of my miscellaneous haskell scripts that I've played with.

Some notable files are
1. `life.hs` - This is code adapted from a 5~ line APL program to simulate the life game
2. `interesting-problems.hs` - This file is for code solutions to small but interesting problems
3. `Modern-compilers` - A Haskell solution to "Modern Compilers in ML"
4. `TAPL` - Haskell versions of the "in ML" chapters of TAPL
5. `Free` - Playing and useage of the Free Monad
6. `data-structures/` - Various data structures made in Haskell
7. `OCAML/` - Various OcaML scripts
   1. `interp` - a mini interpreter in OcaML
   2. `nameless` - Implements da brujin indincies
   3. `nameless-boehm-beraducci` - Reimplements nameless, but using rank 2 F_Ï‰
   4. `nameless-final-first` - tries to do nameless-bb again but this time with module functors, this is the first flawed attempt
