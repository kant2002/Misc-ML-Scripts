* Misc-ML-Scripts
This Repository contains various code examples in the ML programming
language family.


- This repository is split between the various languages.

- Each language repository has their own READMEs for interesting files
  to look out for.

  + Sadly not all files are interesting, this is due to many of them
    being tiny ideas Î™ had.l

    - This mainly applies to the Haskell directories!

- The most interesting directory ordering for anyone reading this
  would probably be.

  1. Fstar

  2. OCaml

  3. Haskell

  4. Idris

  5. Coq
